# 👋 Hi, I'm Manuel

**Fullstack Software Developer | Banking Sector | Backend Specialist**

## 🌟 About Me

I'm a Fullstack Software Developer working in the banking sector since 2022. My main focus is building and maintaining an omnichannel platform with a monolithic architecture based on Java Spring Boot, serving both employees and customers. I also develop a web shop for benefits, bank products (credit cards, debit cards, instant loans, ...), and discounted concert tickets, powered by a Magnolia CMS frontend and a Java backend that communicates with the omnichannel platform via REST.

Recently, I've been involved in making customer-specific journeys and components accessible according to WCAG guidelines.

I’m passionate about improving my skills with current technologies, exploring new frameworks and libraries, and tackling interesting challenges. While backend development is my comfort zone, I enjoy working on the frontend from time to time!

Currently, I'm diving deeper into Data Engineering and Machine Learning.
